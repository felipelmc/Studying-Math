# üßÆStudying Math

Before committing to a graduate program in Political Science, one of my biggest fears as a data scientist was losing the math skills I had worked hard to develop during my undergraduate studies. I now realize that this fear is largely unjustified, as Political Science has a lot to do with Mathematics. 

Nonetheless, I decided to start reading a series of books that will hopefully help me practice and improve in Math, Probability and Statistics. My idea is to use this repository to store my progress, as well as notes and solutions to exercises. 

I picked these books mostly based on some research on curricula of some graduate and undergraduate programs, both from Political Science and Data Science (and related fields).

I'm currently reading and practicing exercises with this book:

‚è≥ Moore, W. H.; Siegel, D. A. (2013). **A Mathematics Couse for Political & Social Research**. Princeton University Press. [link](https://sites.duke.edu/daveasiegel/teaching/math-course/)

Next, I'll (or at least want to) read:

- Strang, G. (2016). **Introduction to Linear Algebra**. Wellesley-Cambridge Press. [link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/readings/)
- Agrest, A. (2018). **Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences**, 5th Edition. Pearson.
- Gill, J.; Bao, L. (2024). **Bayesian Social Science Statistics**. Cambridge University Press.
- Kaplan, D. (2024). **Bayesian Statistics for the Social Sciences**. The Guilford Press.
- Bishop, C. M.; Bishop, H. (2024). Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts. Springer. [link](https://www.bishopbook.com/)
- Izbicki, R. (2025). **Machine Learning Beyond Point Predictions: Uncertainty Quantitification**. [link](https://rafaelizbicki.com/uq4mlpt/)
- Gelman, A.; Hill, J., & Vehtari, A. (2020). **Regression and other stories**. Cambridge University Press.
- McElreath, R. (2020). **Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan**. Chapman and Hall/CRC.
- Gelman, A.; Hill, J. (2006). **Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models**. Cambridge University Press.

Well, yeah, that's probably too much. Let's see what the future holds!
